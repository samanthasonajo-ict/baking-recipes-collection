    <h1>About Baking Recipes Collection</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Baking Recipes Collection</strong> was created as a simple yet meaningful 
      project to bring together some of the most loved baked treats in one cozy space.  
      What started as a small idea—to share easy, no-fail recipes—soon grew into a fun project
      for anyone who loves the smell of freshly baked bread, the sweetness of homemade cookies,
      or the comfort of a slice of cake shared with family and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each recipe in this collection is carefully written with clear steps, helpful tips, and
      a sprinkle of inspiration. Whether you’re a beginner trying out your first muffin or a 
      seasoned home baker experimenting with pies and tarts, this website is meant to be your
      companion in the kitchen. We believe that baking is more than just mixing ingredients—it’s 
      about creating memories, sharing joy, and expressing creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to inspire you to tie on an apron, preheat the oven, and discover the happiness 
      that comes with baking from scratch. From cakes that make birthdays extra special to simple 
      breads that warm your mornings, there’s something here for everyone. We hope you enjoy browsing, 
      learning, and most importantly, baking!
