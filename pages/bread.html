      <h2>Homemade White Bread Loaf</h2>
      <img src="../images/bread-loaf.jpg" alt="Freshly baked homemade bread loaf" width="400" class="recipe-image">

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        There is something incredibly satisfying about baking bread at home. The smell alone can make a house
        feel warm and welcoming. This recipe is a beginner-friendly white loaf that gives you a soft inside
        with a golden crust. The process is simple: mix, knead, proof, shape, and bake. The hardest part is
        waiting for the dough to rise, but patience is rewarded with a loaf that tastes better than store-bought.
        Once you try it, you’ll realize bread-making isn’t complicated — just a little practice and timing.
        You can also use this base dough to create dinner rolls, garlic bread, or cinnamon swirl bread.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>Mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and butter. Mix until dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25–30 minutes until golden and hollow-sounding when tapped.</li>
