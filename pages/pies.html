        Apple pie is one of the most iconic desserts, known for its flaky crust and spiced apple filling. 
        This recipe begins with a buttery pastry dough that is chilled before rolling out to form the crust. 
        Fresh apples are peeled, sliced, and mixed with sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then layered into the crust. 
        A second crust or lattice design is placed on top before baking, giving the pie its classic appearance. 
        When baked, the apples become tender and the filling thickens into a sweet, aromatic mixture. 
        Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or even a slice of sharp cheddar cheese 
        for contrast. Perfect for holidays, picnics, or simple family dinners, apple pie is a timeless dessert 
        that never fails to bring comfort and joy.
