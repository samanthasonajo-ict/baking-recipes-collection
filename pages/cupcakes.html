        Cupcakes are small, delightful cakes that are individually portioned and perfect for sharing. 
        This recipe highlights the classic vanilla cupcake, which is fluffy, moist, and has a soft crumb 
        that pairs beautifully with creamy buttercream frosting. Making cupcakes is simple: start by creaming 
        together butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then add eggs and vanilla for flavor. Dry ingredients 
        like flour and baking powder are folded in, alternating with milk to keep the batter smooth. Once baked, 
        the cupcakes are cooled and topped with swirls of buttercream. You can also add sprinkles, edible glitter, 
        or even fruit toppings to personalize them for parties or celebrations. Cupcakes are versatile, easy to 
        serve, and guaranteed to brighten up any gathering with their fun appearance and sweet taste.
