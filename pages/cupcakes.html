      <h2>Classic Vanilla Cupcakes (with easy buttercream)</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Cupcakes are the perfect little celebration in one bite. These classic vanilla cupcakes are soft,
        moist, and reliably tasty — great for beginners and busy students who want a quick, crowd-pleasing
        dessert. The batter is simple and forgiving: you cream butter and sugar, add eggs and vanilla,
        then fold in dry ingredients with milk. After a quick bake, top with a simple buttercream and
        you have an attractive treat. I like these because they’re easy to portion, decorate, and pack
        for school events or picnics. They also offer endless variation possibilities: swap vanilla for
        lemon zest, fold in berries, or add cocoa for chocolate cupcakes.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper cups.</li>
        <li>Cream butter and sugar until light. Add eggs one at a time, then vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt. Alternate adding dry mix and milk to the butter mix; fold gently.</li>
        <li>Fill cups 2/3 full and bake 15–18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Cool 10 minutes in pan, transfer to rack. Prepare buttercream (butter + powdered sugar + milk + vanilla) and pipe on cooled cupcakes.</li>
        <li>Decorate as you like — sprinkles, zest, or a small fruit make nice finishing touches.</li>
      </ol>
