    <p>
      The <strong>Baking Recipes Collection</strong> was built with love — but also with help 
      from many wonderful resources. This page serves as our way of saying thank you to 
      the creators and bakers who inspire us every day. Every recipe, image, and word 
      comes together because of the passion shared by the global baking community.
    </p>

    <p>
      While most recipes were adapted and rewritten to make them simple and approachable, 
      some inspiration came from classic cookbooks, online tutorials, and home bakers who 
      generously share their creations. Images used for this project were sourced from 
      free platforms like <a href="https://ph.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" class="fw-bold text-decoration-none text-primary">Pinterest</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" class="fw-bold text-decoration-none text-primary">Pexels</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A special thanks to the baking enthusiasts, food bloggers, and teachers who 
      continue to make baking knowledge accessible to everyone. This project is dedicated 
      to them — and to you, the readers and bakers, who keep the joy of baking alive.
